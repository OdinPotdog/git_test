  <p><strong>Dog-lovers have battled through snow to get to day one of Crufts at the NEC near Birmingham.</strong>
  <p><em> Pet owners dressed pooches in an array of blankets, woollies and waterproofs to help them stay warm and dry before competition.
          Show organiser The Kennel Club said roads around the venue were being regularly gritted and shovelled to enable access, with the venue's temperature regulated.
          The annual event runs until 12 March.
          The West Midlands was facing wintry conditions across the region on Thursday, with hundreds of schools shut in freezing temperatures.</em></p>
